[![Netlify Badge](https://www.netlify.com/img/global/badges/netlify-color-accent.svg)](https://basiljs2.netlify.com/)

This repo holds the [site/docs for Basil.js](https://basiljs.github.io/). The current state of development (develop branch) can be found here [basiljs2.netlify.com](https://basiljs2.netlify.com/)
## Update Basil API  

If there are changes to the API of Basil.js you can update the data on this repo as follows.  

```bash

git pull git@github.com:basiljs/basiljs.github.io.git
cd basiljs.github.io
# get all branches
git fetch -a
# get into the develop branch
git checkout -b develop origin/develop
# now make your new branch based on develop
git checkout -b chore/update-docs
# build the new data source for the site
# This will:  

# - Pull the Basil.js' branch `develop` with npm from GitHub (eventually this should be the master, not the develop branch).
# - Generate the file `./build-scripts/api/data.json` from `./node_modules/basiljs/basil.js` using [documentation.js](http://documentation.js.org/).
# - Generate the following files for the index.
#    + `./_data/categories.json`
#    + `./_data/cats-and-subcats.json`
# - Also generate all the files for the subpages of `_source/reference`.  
npm run build:api-markup
# After that you can just commit all the changes and push it the repo again. Netlify will take care of the Jekyll build.  
# Only add the files you really want to.
# Adding all with `git add .` is acutally not the right way
# use gits interactive mode or some more specific paths then `.`
git add -i
git commit -m "chore: Update Basil.js api to latest state [Add your favorite emoji here]"
# push current HEAD to remote
git push -u origin HEAD
# Now go to the GitHub UI and create your PR
```

## Development

To build these docs we are using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You need both of these to develop on this.  

- Create a new branch based on branch `develop` (see the code above for a how to ðŸ‘†).
- Do your thing
- Create a pull request against develop

Netlify will create a branch and deploy preview for you and you can see your changes online. Every push to your branch will trigger a new build and will be linked on the PR page.

To develop locally take a look at the steps below. ðŸ‘‡

### Markup + SCSS

Most of the Jekyll [liquid magic](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) happens in `./_source`.  

To develop in this run:

```bash
# once
bundle install
bundle update
# whenever you want to work on the markup/content
# (the --limit_posts 1 --incremental flags are needed
# because we have lots of pages and need to speedup the build)
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --limit_posts 1 --incremental
```

### Javascript

To work on the Javasscript of the site you need to run

```bash
# once
# needs npm v5.7 or higer
npm ci
# when you develop on it
# (starts the webpack dev watch build toolchain)
npm run webpack:dev
```

## Recipes

Resize and crop multiple images using [`mogrify`](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php)  

```bash
mogrify -resize 320x180^ -gravity Center -extent 320x180 -quality 100 -format png ./*/thumbnail.jpg

```
