description: 'Used with b.go() to set Performance Mode. Processes Document in background mode. Document will not be visible until the script is done. If you are firing on a open document you''ll need to save it before calling b.go(). The document will be removed from the display list and added again after the script is done. In this mode you will likely look at indesign with no open document for quite some time - do not work in indesign during this time. You may want to use b.println("yourMessage") in your script and look at the Console in estk to get information about the process.'
