description: "The `split()` function breaks a string into pieces using a character or string as the divider. The `delim` parameter specifies the character or characters that mark the boundaries between each piece. An array of strings is returned that contains each of the pieces.\n\nThe `splitTokens()` function works in a similar fashion, except that it splits using a range of characters instead of a specific character or sequence."
