description: '`addPath()` is used to create multi component paths. Call `addPath()` to add the vertices drawn so far to a single path. New vertices will then end up in a new path and `endShape()` will return a multi path object. All component paths will account for the setting (see `CLOSE`) given in `beginShape(shapeMode)`.'
