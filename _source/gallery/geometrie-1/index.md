Pascal Imhof

The brief of this first year seminar at the Visual Communication Institute in Basel is to design a cover for a fictional book about Generative Design entitled “Geometrie 1”. Students learned how to generate ornamental and formal visuals that represent some of the core principles such as repetition, chaos and the fluid transition between mouse and code-based design with basil.js and Adobe InDesign.
