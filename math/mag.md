title: mag()
description: 'Calculates the magnitude (or length) of a vector. A vector is a direction in space commonly used in computer graphics and linear algebra. Because it has no "start" position, the magnitude of a vector can be thought of as the distance from coordinate (0,0) to its (x,y) value. Therefore, mag() is a shortcut for writing "dist(0, 0, x, y)".'
