title: noise()
description: 'Returns the Perlin noise value at specified coordinates. Perlin noise is a random sequence generator producing a more natural ordered, harmonic succession of numbers compared to the standard random() function. It was invented by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in graphical applications to produce procedural textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.'
