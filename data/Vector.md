title: Vector()
description: 'A class to describe a two or three dimensional vector. This datatype stores two or three variables that are commonly used as a position, velocity, and/or acceleration. Technically, position is a point and velocity and acceleration are vectors, but this is often simplified to consider all three as vectors. For example, if you consider a rectangle moving across the screen, at any given instant it has a position (the object''s location, expressed as a point.), a velocity (the rate at which the object''s position changes per time unit, expressed as a vector), and acceleration (the rate at which the object''s velocity changes per time unit, expressed as a vector). Since vectors represent groupings of values, we cannot simply use traditional addition/multiplication/etc. Instead, we''ll need to do some "vector" math, which is made easy by the methods inside the Vector class.'
